The Xen Roll also supports building virtual clusters.
The frontend can be installed as a <emphasis>VM server</emphasis> appliance
and the client nodes can be installed as VM containers.
Then a virtual frontend can be installed on the VM server while virtual
compute nodes can be installed on the VM containers.
All network traffic is encapsulated within a unique VLAN, that is, each
virtual cluster has its own VLAN.
