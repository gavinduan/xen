	<title> Adding, Installing and Booting VMs </title>

<para>
In the common case, you will execute three Rocks commands over the
lifetime of your VMs: add (to add VM info to the database), create (to
install a newly added VM) and start (to boot an installed VM).
</para>

<para>
To add a VM to the system, you need to associate a VM with a physical
machine (i.e., a VM container) and you need to assign an appliance type to
the VM.
Here's an example:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks add host vm vm-container-0-0 membership="Compute"
</screen>

<para>
The above command will output a message similar to:
</para>

<screen>
added VM compute-0-0-0 on physical node vm-container-0-0
</screen>

<para>
This tells us that, in the database, the compute VM named "compute-0-0-0"
has been assigned to the physical machine "vm-container-0-0".
</para>

<para>
The next step is to install the VM.
</para>

<para>
VMs are installed with the <computeroutput>start</computeroutput> command
with the <computeroutput>install=yes</computeroutput> flag.
Here's how to install the VM that was added above:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks start host vm compute-0-0-0 install=yes
</screen>

<para>
The above command will start the standard Rocks installation process for
the VM named "compute-0-0-0".
After the installation process initializes the network inside the VM, you
can monitor the installation just like a physical machine installation
by executing:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks-console compute-0-0-0
</screen>

<para>
After the installation completes, the VM will reboot.
After the VM boots, you can interact with the VM just like any other physical
machine.
</para>
