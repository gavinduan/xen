<para>
After you install a VM Server and at least one VM Container, you are ready
to install a virtual cluster.
</para>

<para>
We'll use the following illustration as a guide to help keep track of the
names of the physical machines and the virtual machines.
</para>

<para>
<mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
		<imagedata fileref="images/virtual-cluster.png" scale=50>
	</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>

<para>
In the above picture, "espresso.rocksclusters.org" is a physical machine.
Also, "vm-container-0-0" and "vm-container-0-1" are physical machines that
were kickstarted by "espresso".
The machine "frontend-0-0-0" is a virtual machine that is hosted by
"espresso".
The machines "hosted-vm-0-0-0" and "hosted-vm-0-1-0" are VMs that are
associated with "frontend-0-0-0" (they are all in the same VLAN).
The names "frontend-0-0-0", "hosted-vm-0-0-0" and "hosted-vm-0-1-0" are
names used by physical machine to control the VMs (e.g., to start and
stop them).
</para>

<para>
The names in the virtual cluster looks like the names in a traditional
cluster -- the frontend is named "vi-1.rocksclusters.org" and its compute
nodes are named "compute-0-0" and "compute-0-1".
If you login to "vi-1.rocksclusters.org", you would be hard pressed to tell
the difference between this virtual cluster and a physical cluster.
</para>

<para>
First, we'll add a virtual cluster to the VM Server's database.
In this example, we'll add a frontend with the FQDN of
"vi-1.rocksclusters.org", IP of "137.110.119.118" and we'll associate
2 compute nodes with it:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks add cluster fqdn="vi-1.rocksclusters.org" ip="137.110.119.118" num-computes=2
</screen>

<para>
The above command will take some time and then output something similar to:
</para>

<screen>
created frontend VM named: frontend-0-0-0 
	created compute VM named: hosted-vm-0-0-0
	created compute VM named: hosted-vm-0-1-0
</screen>

<para>
The command adds entries to the database for the above nodes and establishes
a VLAN that will be used for the private network (eth0 inside the VM).
</para>

<para>
Info about all the defined clusters on the VM Server (including the
physical cluster) can be obtained with the command:
<computeroutput>rocks list cluster</computeroutput>.
For example:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks list cluster
FRONTEND                    CLIENT NODES     TYPE    
espresso.rocksclusters.org: ---------------- physical
:                           vm-container-0-0 physical
:                           vm-container-0-1 physical
vi-1.rocksclusters.org:     ---------------- VM      
:                           hosted-vm-0-0-0  VM      
:                           hosted-vm-0-1-0  VM
</screen>

<para>
Now we need to install the VM frontend.
This is done by "starting" the VM:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks start host vm vi-1.rocksclusters.org
</screen>

<para>
To interact with the VM frontend's console, you need to start "virt-manager"
</para>

<screen>
# virt-manager
</screen>

<para>
This will display a screen similar to:
</para>

<para>
<mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
		<imagedata fileref="images/virt-manager-1.png" scale=50>
	</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>

<para>
Double click on the "localhost" entry and then you'll see:
</para>

<para>
<mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
		<imagedata fileref="images/virt-manager-2.png" scale=50>
	</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>

<para>
To bring the up the console for the VM frontend, double click on
"frontend-0-0-0".
Now you should see the familiar frontend installation screen:
</para>

<para>
<mediaobject>
	<imageobject>
		<imagedata fileref="images/virt-manager-4.png" scale=50>
	</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>

<para>
In the "Hostname of Roll Server" field, insert the FQDN of your VM Server
(the name of the physical machine that is hosting the VM frontend).
Then click "Download".
</para>

<para>
From here, you want to follow the
<ulink url="/roll-documentation/base/&document_version;/install-frontend.html">standard procedure for bringing up a frontend</ulink> starting at Step 8.
</para>

<para>
After the VM frontend installs, it will reboot.
After it reboots, login and then we'll begin installing VM compute nodes.
</para>

	<title>Installing VM Compute Nodes</title>

<para>
After you login to the VM frontend, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# insert-ethers
</screen>

<para>
Select "Compute" as the appliance type.
</para>

<para>
Back on the VM Server, we'll need to start the first VM that hosts the
VM compute node.
In this example, the name is "hosted-vm-0-0-0".
</para>

<screen>
# rocks start host vm hosted-vm-0-0-0 install=yes
</screen>

<para>
Back in the VM frontend, you should see insert-ethers discover the VM compute
node.
</para>

<para>
Screen Shot
</para>

<para>
Repeat for each VM compute node.
</para>

<para>
You now have a virtual cluster up and running within your physical cluster.
</para>
