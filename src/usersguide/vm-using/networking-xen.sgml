<section><title>Networking with XEN Roll</title>
<para>
In order to support XEN Virtual machines, it is necessary to have a particular network configuration on the 
hosting servers. In particular bridges must be set up to provide Virtual Machine with network connectivity.
In this section, we describe the various kinds of bridging scenarios 
for virtual machines and how to set them up. For these examples, the physical machine will be called
vm-container-0-0.
</para>
<section>
<title>VM Network Bridging to Physical Devices</title>
<para>
When a VM is bridged to the physical device, it must be assigned in the same subnet as the physical device with 
a compatible IP address (this case is exactly what is described in <xref linkend="using-vm-physical-frontend"> ).
</para>

			<para> FIGURE: The Virtual machine is bridged to eth0. In this case eth0 of the
			VM is in the same subnet (with a compatible IP) address. The VM and the container 
			will be able to ping each other. This was the only configuration supported in Rocks
			5.0 
			</para>
		</caption>
        </mediaobject>
</para>
<para>
The following example shows this most basic of bridging scenarios. The guest (compute-0-0-1) and the
container (vm-container-0-0)  are in the same IP subnet and will be able to ping each other. 
</para>

[root@tranquil images]# rocks list host interface vm-container-0-0 compute-0-0-1

<section>
<title>Logical VLAN Devices</title>
<para>
In this scenario, The guest (hosted-vm-0-0-0) and the host (vm-container-0-0) are not in the same logical
network (this is the scenario described in <xref linkend="provisioning-virtual-cluster">).
</para>

[root@rocks ~]# rocks list host interface vm-container-0-0 hosted-vm-0-0-0
HOST              SUBNET  IFACE MAC               IP             NETMASK   MODULE NAME             VLAN

vm-container-0-0: private vlan2 ----------------- -------------- --------- ------ ---------------- 2    
</screen>
<para> 
In the above configuration, Logical VLAN device vlan2 (with tag=2) will be on the physical network eth0 on
vm-container-0-0.  The hosted-vm-0-0-0 (a Rocks "appliance" that simply holds a generic VM guest) will have
have its interface on VLAN=2.  The physical machine must have a Logical vlan device with the same tag. 
</para>
<para> 
Below we give a more complicated configuration and walk through exactly what is bridged where. 
</para>
<screen>
[root@rocks ~]# rocks list host interface vm-container-0-0

[root@rocks ~]# rocks list host interface hosted-vm-0-0-0
SUBNET IFACE MAC               IP NETMASK MODULE NAME            VLAN
------ eth0  00:16:3e:00:00:05 -- ------- ------ hosted-vm-0-0-0 2    
------ eth1  00:16:3e:00:00:80 -- ------- ------ --------------- 100   
</screen>
<para>
In the above scenario, if hosted-vm-0-0-0 (Xen guest, DomU) were to be booted
on physical host vm-container-0-0 (Dom0), the packets from the guest on eth0
will be tagged with VLAN=2, and eth1 with
VLAN=100.  The host machine must have Logical VLAN interfaces called "vlan*.".  To make the proper
bridge configuration, Rocks will match the VLANs of the guest interfaces to the VLANs on the host. 
On the host, logical interface vlan2 is labeled as being on the private network (eth0) and logical vlan100
is labeled as being on the net10 network (eth1).
